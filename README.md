# NeuronGuard

**An ultra-fast, cache-aligned neuromorphic event engine bridging bare-metal Rust with an idiomatic, GIL-free Python SDK.**

NeuronGuard is not a deep learning matrix-multiplication library. It is a highly specialized associative memory engine designed for edge intelligence, real-time control, and transparent classification. It runs **entirely on the CPU**, training on 100,000+ samples in under 3 seconds, all while fitting entirely within L1/L2 CPU cache lines.

## NeuronLake Lake Configuration

NeuronLake uses `lake.yaml` as the user-owned source of truth for the local expert lake. The Milestone 1 schema is intentionally small: a lake name, one or more expert definitions, and server settings for the future OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```yaml
name: frontend-lake

experts:
  - id: javascript-core
    domain: JavaScript language and runtime behavior
    model: ./models/javascript-core-0.5b.gguf
    routing_hints:
      - javascript
      - node
      - promise
    examples:
      - Explain JavaScript async behavior with small runnable examples.

server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  model_name: library-lake-v1
```

Each expert must define a stable `id`, a non-empty `domain`, and a model reference. The shorthand `model: ./path/to/model.gguf` form is treated as a local model path unless it looks like a remote reference such as `https://...` or `hf://...`. Detailed model references can use `path`, `remote`, or `imported`, with an optional `cache_path`.

Relative local paths are resolved from the directory containing `lake.yaml`, not from the process working directory. This keeps a lake portable when the server is started from another folder.

Optional expert metadata can include `routing_hints`, `examples`, `sharing`, `version`, `compatibility`, and `training_status`. The Lake runtime does not require a `teacher` section; teacher-student configuration belongs to later offline dataset and evaluation workflows.

## The Technology (How it works)

Instead of dense floating-point matrices, NeuronGuard models intelligence as a network of **cache-aligned, thread-bounded neurons** that communicate via discrete event spikes. 

* **Cache-Aligned Memory**: Every neuron is packed into exactly 64 bytes. This guarantees deterministic hardware pre-fetching and completely eliminates false sharing.
* **GIL-Free Parallelism**: Stream and batch processing instantly drops the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), utilizing all CPU cores for parallel, lock-free memory mutations.
* **Zero-Copy Serialization**: Models are flat, pointerless memory structures. Saving is an instant memory dump, and loading uses `mmap` to map the weights straight from disk into memory in `<1ms`.

## Python SDK Reference

The high-level Python SDK handles vocabulary building, tokenization (in native Rust), hyperparameter scaling, and out-of-the-box diagnostics.

### `TextClassifier`
Handles high-speed text classification with discriminative vocabulary scoring.

```python
from neuronguard import TextClassifier

# Initialise the TextClassifier with 4 classes
classifier = TextClassifier(
    num_classes=4,
    vocab_size=1000,
    class_names=["World", "Sports", "Business", "Sci/Tech"],
)

# Train the model. Identify the text,label index in the CSV and run for 5 epochs
classifier.fit("train.csv", text_col=[1, 2], label_col=0, epochs=5)

# Evaluate with a similar setup.
accuracy, report = classifier.evaluate("test.csv", text_col=[1, 2], label_col=0)

# Make a prediction
print(classifier.predict_name("Football match ends in a draw"))  # -> "Sports"

# Save the model
classifier.save("./model_dir")

# Load the model and make a prediction
fast_model = TextClassifier.load("./model_dir")
print(fast_model.predict_name("Football match ends in a draw"))
```

### 2. `TabularClassifier`
Automatically buckets continuous numerical features and handles extreme class imbalances (like fraud detection) using internal class weighting.

```python
from neuronguard import TabularClassifier

# Features are automatically bucketed into 10 buckets each.
# use_feature_interactions=True mathematically hashes pairs of metrics together, 
# allowing the engine to instantly learn 2D non-linear patterns (e.g. Physics Data).
classifier = TabularClassifier(
    num_classes=2, 
    num_features=5, 
    buckets_per_feature=10,
    use_feature_interactions=True,
    interaction_vocab_size=1000000
)

# Seamlessly handles continuous data in O(1) time
classifier.fit(
    records=[(V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, label)], 
    feature_indices=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 
    label_index=5
)
prediction = classifier.predict([1.2, 0.4, 9.9, 3.1, 0.0])
```

### 3. Diagnostics & Explainability (White-Box AI)
Because NeuronGuard is a direct associative memory, we can perfectly trace exactly which tokens contributed to a prediction. No more guessing why the model failed.

```python
# 1. Extract exactly what the model learned for a class
classifier.print_class_features(class_idx=1, top_k=3)
# Output:
#   - 'urgent' (Weight: +105)
#   - 'bank' (Weight: +105)

# 2. Transparently explain a single prediction
classifier.print_explanation("urgent meeting to reset password")
# Output:
#   'urgent    ' -> Spam: +105w
#   'meeting   ' -> Work: +105w
#   'reset     ' -> Spam: +105w
```

### 4. Continuous Online Learning
Because NeuronGuard uses biological topological plasticity instead of backpropagation, models can be updated on the fly without retraining from scratch.

```python
# 1. A stream of new labelled data arrives in production
correction = [(1, "my account upgrade to the premium plan failed")]

# 2. Update the model instantly (zero-overhead, <1ms)
classifier.update_records(correction)
```

### 5. Instant Machine Unlearning (GDPR Compliance)
In traditional Deep Learning, if a user requests their data be deleted (Right to be Forgotten), the entire model must often be retrained from scratch. Because NeuronGuard uses reversible Hebbian plasticity rather than entangled gradient descent, you can instantly erase a record's influence by simply passing it to `.unlearn_records()`.

```python
# Instantly subtracts the exact synaptic weight modifications caused by this record
classifier.unlearn_records([(0, "Delete my private email address test@example.com")])
```

### 6. Raw Rust Batch API (GIL-Free)
For ultimate performance, bypass the high-level classes and write batch processing loops using the raw Rust `NeuronGuardField` directly.

```python
import time
import neuronguard as ng

field = ng.NeuronGuardField(sensory_count=10000, motor_count=4)

# Train 100,000 tasks instantly across all cores using Rayon
field.train_batch(batch_train_tasks, amplify_delta=15, suppress_delta=5)

# Predict 100,000 times in milliseconds
results = field.predict_batch(batch_predict_tasks)
```
